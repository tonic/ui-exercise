# Todo List Design Exercise

We've put together a small React todo application that we'd like you to design out. This exercise should take approximately 1&ndash;2 hours, and is not expected to be the world's most beautiful todo app.

Feel free to change markup at your preference. And, of course, use any resources that you would normally have at your disposal (Google, Stack Overflow, etc.). If you have questions, don't hesitate to [contact us](mailto:developer@hellotonic.com).

## System Requirements

* Node
* npm

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Run development server:

```bash
$ npm start
```

## Minimum Requirements

There are no specific requirements of what we're looking for. However, your design should demonstrate knowledge of CSS frameworks, SCSS, and UX design patterns. Ideally your project should fulfill the following:

* A CSS framework of your choice (or roll your own base if you're feeling up to it)
* Variables and mixins that are leveraged in your design
* Some form of basic responsive design

## Things We'll Keep an Eye On

* Organization of your styles
* Code comments
* Comfort with CSS specificity and brevity
* Reasoning behind your decisions

## Submission Guidelines

Please create a new repository on GitHub and send us a link. Alternatively, you may send us an archive by [email](mailto:developer@hellotonic.com). Please do not fork this repository.
